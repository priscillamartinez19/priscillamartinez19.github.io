 During my time volunteering at the ELA Veterans Center, I have taken on a variety of roles that have allowed me to serve the veterans in our community while gaining valuable experience. One of my main responsibilities has been managing the front office desk as a customer service representative, where Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to greet veterans and ensure they are welcomed and assisted efficiently. In addition to this, I have been tasked with scheduling and maintaining records of office visits for every veteran who comes in, ensuring that all appointments are properly logged and up-to-date. I also oversee the office storage room, which involves regular stocking and organizing of materials to ensure that supplies are readily available for both staff and visitors. This organizational role extends to keeping the office kitchen area clean and orderly, which helps create a welcoming and comfortable environment for our wonderful staff. By staying on top of these duties, Iâ€™ve been able to ensure that the office staff stays on schedule with appointments, and I take care to log every appointment accurately in our online system. Additionally, part of my role includes printing out the weekly schedules for all the doctors, ensuring that each veteranâ€™s visit is confirmed and no appointment is overlooked. Volunteering at the Veterans Center has also given me the rewarding opportunity to directly assist veterans when they come in to see their doctors, especially helping those who may face language barriers. Iâ€™ve been able to assist Spanish-speaking visitors by acting as a translator, ensuring they receive the full support they need during their visit. This experience has been incredibly fulfilling, as it has allowed me to contribute to the well-being of those who have served our country while also developing my own skills in communication, organization, and customer service.

In my current role at the 4S Education Foundation, I have the privilege of mentoring high school seniors throughout their journey of applying to universities. This program is designed to support students at every step of the application process, offering guidance on selecting schools, navigating the application process, applying for financial aid, and finding scholarships, while also preparing them for the transition from high school to college life. We begin the process in early July, helping students assess their interests, strengths, and goals to determine which universities align best with their aspirations. From July through December, we assist students in crafting their college applications, providing constructive feedback and revising their essays to ensure they present their best selves. During this time, mentors also guide mentees through the intricate steps of applying for financial aid, ensuring they understand the process and are aware of deadlines. In parallel, we help students identify and apply for scholarships, offering them additional financial support that can make a significant difference. As spring approaches, typically in April, we reconvene with our mentees to review their college acceptances and, together, we discuss the pros and cons of each school to help them make an informed decision about where to attend. At this stage, we also provide advice and tips on how to set them up for success in their new academic environments, covering everything from time management to adjusting to campus life. Throughout this entire process, our goal is to equip students with the knowledge, resources, and confidence they need to successfully transition from high school to higher education.
